Okay, now I'm pretty sure that I can delete the template text and add my own.<br>

I guess now to find out if this HTML or plain text. I'll try to add a photo.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ianmcphee/ianmcphee.github.io/blob/master/0.jpg?raw=true">
<br>
I wonder if the way I sourced that image is right. Didn't I learn something about image hosting vs bandwidth years ago? Oh well.
